# Seattle Crime Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of the [Seattle Crime Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/seattle-crime-stats)

## The Dataset
I recommend looking at the original descriptions of this dataset (which is separated across two CSV files) as they were first [posted of the City of Seattle's Open Data platorm](https://data.seattle.gov/).

The two CSV files hold data for Seattle crime, each is taken over a different time span.

One of the files records Seattle Crime data over the years 1996-2007. Looking it's description on [Seattle's  Data platorm](https://data.seattle.gov/), we know that it has **4 features,**, which are as follows:

    - Report_Year: Reporting Year
    - Census_Tract_1990: The 1990 census tract the reported crimes occurred in
    - Crime_Type: Type of crime
    - Report_Year_Total: Total number of crimes reported
    
The other file records crime data over the years from 2008 to present time. The features in this dataset are as follows:

    - Police Beat: Designated police beat boundary where offense(s) occurred.
    - CRIME_TYPE: Type of crime
    - CRIME_DESCRIPTION: Definition for the type of crime committed.
    - STAT_VALUE: *currently unknown*
    - REPORT_DATE: Date and time the offense(s) was reported. (Can differ from date of occurrence) 
    - Sector: Designated police sector boundary where offense(s) occurred. 
    - Precinct: Designated police precinct boundary where offense(s) occurred. 
    - Row_Value_ID: Primary value for the crime
    
Note: these descriptions were taken from the SPD_DSG_OFFENSE_METADATA.pdf document, which can be downloaded from this dataset's [latest posting on the Seattle open data platform](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5).
